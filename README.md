Share the rails app on github
Create your model classes using rails generate scaffold (see https://github.com/info3/rails_01_fragen for an example)
create many small commits:
Develop your story test driven. See the example in https://github.com/info3/rails_testing_example for integration test examples (and setup!)
Continuous Integration: copy the .travis.yml travis setup (you might want to delete one of the ruby versions from it) to your repository and set up a travis-ci.org build for it.
